        <h1>A Foundation in Creativity</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Art was always my thing. I wanted to create my own world and fill it with the beauty I saw around me.</li>
          <li>I never had the patience to shop and buy the things I wanted - if I had a vision, I'd try to create it first. Whether I'd tried something similar before or not. I ended up with lots of disasters and a few injuries, but I always loved it!</li>

        <h1>Discovering a Love of the Technical</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I was fascinated by science and logic. It wasn't separate frommy creativity - it was just a more ordered form of it.</li>
          <li>When I discovered programming, I fell in love. It's detail oriented, creative, and just plain fun.</li>
          <li>I discovered a passion for clever solutions - it's like art, but there's a winner!</li>

        <h1>Passion for Play</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I have always wanted to create things that excite people, from my middle-school paintings to my most complex projects.</li>
          <li>Play is a uniquely free space, a place to explore and experiement without fear.</li>
          <li>I love to create games because they bring delight, without losing meaning or falling flat. They're powerful and simple, and I'm just passionate about them!</li>
